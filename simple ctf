first we enumerate all the sites
with dirbuster,dirb, gobuster and
then we see the vuln site, file, and find out username and passwd
then we use that to enter in ftp or ssh
if we get ftp we again find user and passwd for ssh 
after getting ssh user and passwd we will see user.txt or s2cr3t files and enumerate all the users and passwds then 
we use sudo -l to see if can escalate for the root 
we get the nopasswd in it and we will search for /usr/bin/vim etc can be there then we will search on google for exploit related it and then get the root access and then enumerate all the files and find the passwd and user



here i learned syntax
python exploit.py -u http://<ip>/<page> --crack -w /usr/share/worlists/rockyou.txt

Escalation
We can see that are we user or root? By command "id" on terminal
sudo -l
got the nopasswd on /usr/bin/vim
found vuln on GTFOBins website that 
for reverse shell we can do for post exploitation



GTFOBins website have all the exploits related to escalation of /usr/bin/<any>
