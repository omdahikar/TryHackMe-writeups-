First use wireshark to open .pcap file then 
Find http protocol and use tcp stream follow 
And download steam data with raw format and file name would be stream.raw
Use python code to extract the images from stream.raw file in stream.py



import re

def extract_jpegs(raw_file, output_dir):
 with open(raw_file, 'rb') as f:
 data = f.read()
 # Split by boundary
 parts = data.split(b'--BoundaryString')
 for i, part in enumerate(parts):
 if b'JFIF' in part: # Check for JPEG data
 # Extract JPEG content after headers
 jpeg_start = part.find(b'\xFF\xD8')
 jpeg_end = part.rfind(b'\xFF\xD9') + 2
 if jpeg_start != -1 and jpeg_end != -1:
 jpeg_data = part[jpeg_start:jpeg_end]
 with open(f'{output_dir}/frame_{i}.jpg', 'wb') as img:
 img.write(jpeg_data)

extract_jpegs('stream.raw', 'frames')

Use the above code
